npm i --save react react-dom next


no need to import react or react dom onto indexjs or 
    anywhere, it is already done through package.json
    in next project.

create pages directory
add index.js and any other pages
code!

client side navigation:
    -use next Link for navigation
    -on pages, imort Link from 'next/link'
    -set up links from index page to about:
        -(
            <div>
                <h2>Hello from NextJS</h2>
                <Link href="/about">
                    <a>About</a>
                </Link>
            </div>
        )
    -set up links from about page to index:
        -(
            <div>
                <h2>About Page</h2>
                <Link href="/">
                    <a>Home</a>
                </Link>
            </div>
        )


    the <a> tags are used so that you can apply styling, because the Link tag doesn't
        show any styling added to that tag.

    -scoped styling doesn't apply globally, it stays withing the scope of the page and
        where it is defined to be used:
            -example:
            <p>This is p div to show the NextJS styling using style tags <br />
                which are placed inside of the returned div for page, <br />
                DO NOT <br />
                place inside of Link tags, that only supports 1 child...
            </p>
            <style jsx>
                {`
                    p {
                        color: indigo;
                        font-size: 20px;
                        font-weight: light;
                    }           
                `}
            </style>


building components to use in the pages:
    -create components folder in main directory
    -example component for nav:
        -create nav.js file
        -imort Link from 'next/link'
        create function to return, adding in links



to add bootstrap css (or any other) and override the NextJS document, 
    add a page to the pages folder called _document


to render images in next, create a folder in the root called "static"
    -as long as you ahve all images in the static folder, you don't have to do 
    anything to import them into the pages or components.
    -may have to refresh app to see changes here.


adding your own CSS :
    -add styles.css to your static folder
    -then got to _document page and add in link to the css page in header
